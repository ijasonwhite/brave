## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

Laravel Tech Test (eCommerce)

    Build a simple eCommerce application using Laravel with the following features:
    Note: There is no need to produce the administration dashboard in this test.
    
    ● Product Catalogue: Display a list of products with details like name, description,
    price, image, and variations (like size, colour, etc.). The products and their
    variations should be stored in a database.
    
    ● Product Variations: Each product can have multiple variations, each with its own
    SKU, price, and inventory. Users should be able to select a variation when adding
    the product to the cart.
    
    ● Shopping Cart: Users should be able to add product variations to a shopping cart.
    The cart should update to reﬂect the total price of all items.
    
    ● Checkout Process: Implement a checkout process where users can review their
    cart, enter shipping information, and make a payment. (This does not need to
    actually connect to a payment provider)
    
    ● User Authentication: Implement a user registration and login system. Only
    logged-in users should be able to checkout.
    
    ● Order History: Users should be able to view their past orders, including the
    speciﬁc product variations they purchased.
